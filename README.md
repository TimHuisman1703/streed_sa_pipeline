# STreeD Survival Analysis experiment pipeline

This repository contains the files used to test and compare STreeD to other algorithms in terms of creating survival trees.

The source code of STreeD needs to be located in a folder called `streed2` within the repository, with a Release executable located at `streed2/out/build/x64-Release/STREED.exe`. If this executable is in a different place, the relative path found in `step_5_run_streed.py` must be changed accordingly.
