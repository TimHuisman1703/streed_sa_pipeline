depth[d]_[mode]_[is_timed]_[datasets]

Arguments:
d           = The maximum depth the experiments were run with, or 'inc' for increasing depth
mode        = "direct" if no hypertuning was done, "hyper" if it was
is_timed    = "timed" if the time is reliable and matters, "untimed" if not
datasets    = "real" if the real datasets were used, "synthetic" if the synthetically generated datasets were used
